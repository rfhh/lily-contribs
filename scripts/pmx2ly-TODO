- slur start broken again(!)
- accidentals work for the *staff*, not for just a single voice in the staff.
  ** This requires refactoring the accidental implementation: it must
  live in the staff, not in the voice, and is handled at calculate-time.
- movement breaks
- line breaks???
- page breaks???
- afterGrace
- forced accidentals
- titles
- (final) bar line(s)
- repeats
  Are the manual repeat bars and voltas transformed into lilypond \repeat
  \volta sections, or do we just, easily, retain the manual repeat bars and
  volta indications?
- expand --- --- sections
- expand \def... sections using tme http://www.astro.indiana.edu/~jthorn/software.html#tme
- handle end-of-tex\def correctly: a '\' on its own
- keep line/column counts into input
- 'relative' accidentals ( :-( )
- bar markups (h and l)
- noBeam
- variable number of beams
- skips
- segno
- multibar rests in one voice should give skips in empty other voices
  ** For efficiency, and for ease of programming, this requires refactoring
  so each voice maintains its global time, not bar + time-in-bar.

- lyrics

- add options:
   - accidental for all octaves or only for explicitly set octaves? This
     is a well-known musical issue
   - option to follow line breaks
   - option to follow page breaks

- write little validation suite for:
   - multi-voice
   - multi-voice accidentals
   - grace notes, incl multinote graces
   - forced accidentals
   - titles
   - movements
   - (final) bar line(s)
   - every feature and all combinations of features
