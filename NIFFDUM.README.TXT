CAUTION!  There are four lines in NIFFDUM2.C that are platform specific.  They redirect stdout to the file "output.txt" and back.  Those lines are commented and should be very simple to change.  If your platform supports drag and drop, you should just be able to drag the Niff file you want converted to the executable's icon to initiate the dump.Happy Niffing,Dr. Terence Kellytkelly@pressenter.com
