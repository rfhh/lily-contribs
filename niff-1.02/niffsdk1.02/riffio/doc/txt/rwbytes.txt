 SYNOPSIS
 ========

 - RIFFIORead8()
 - RIFFIORead16()
 - RIFFIORead32()
 - RIFFIOReadFOURCC()
 
 - RIFFIOWrite8()
 - RIFFIOWrite16()

 RETURN
 ======
 All of these routines return a zero RIFFIOSuccess on failure.

 ERRORS
 ======
 On failure, the RIFFIOFile position is undefined.
 None of these functions call RIFFIOError.



 RIFFIORead8
 ===========
 Read an unsigned 8-bit integer from a RIFF file.

| RIFFIOSuccess
| RIFFIORead8(RIFFIOFile *prf, unsigned char *ucp)

 RIFFIORead16
 ============
 Read an unsigned 16-bit integer from a RIFF file.

| RIFFIOSuccess
| RIFFIORead16(RIFFIOFile *prf, unsigned short *usp)

 RIFFIORead32
 ============
 Read an unsigned 32-bit integer from a RIFF file.

| RIFFIOSuccess
| RIFFIORead32(RIFFIOFile *prf, unsigned long *ulp)

 RIFFIOReadFOURCC
 ================
 Read a four-character code from a RIFF file.

| RIFFIOSuccess
| RIFFIOReadFOURCC(RIFFIOFile *prf, RIFFIOFOURCC *fccp)

 RIFFIOWrite8
 ============
 Write an unsigned 8-bit integer to a RIFF file.

| RIFFIOSuccess
| RIFFIOWrite8(RIFFIOFile *prf, unsigned char uc)
 
 RIFFIOWrite16
 =============
 Write an unsigned 16-bit integer to a RIFF file.

| RIFFIOSuccess
| RIFFIOWrite16(RIFFIOFile *prf, unsigned short us)

 RIFFIOWrite32
 =============
 Write an unsigned 32-bit integer to a RIFF file.
 
| RIFFIOSuccess
| RIFFIOWrite32(RIFFIOFile *prf, unsigned long ul)

 RIFFIOWriteFOURCC
 =================
 Write a four-character code to a RIFF file.
