 NAME
 ====
 fcc - Four-character code operations
 
 SYNOPSIS
 ========

 - RIFFIOFOURCCIsValid()
 - RIFFIOFOURCCToString()



 RIFFIOFOURCCIsValid
 ===================
 Check the validity of a four-character code.

| int
| RIFFIOFOURCCIsValid(RIFFIOFOURCC fcc)

 Check <fcc> according to the rules

 - alphanumeric ASCII characters only [A-Z],[0-9],[a-z]

 - padded on the right with spaces

 - no embedded spaces

 RETURN
 ------
 1 - if fcc is valid,

 0 - otherwise
 
 BUGS
 ----
 This does not work on FOURCC's that require escape codes to 
 represent them in string form.


 RIFFIOFOURCCToString
 ====================
 Write a four-character code into a string.

| void
| RIFFIOFOURCCToString(const RIFFIOFOURCC fcc, char *str)

 ENTRY
 -----
 T <*str> must already be allocated to hold at 
 least RIFFIO_FOURCC_MIN characters.

 EXIT
 ----
 Writes the four characters (possibly using escape sequences) 
 of <fcc> and a terminating NUL into <*str>.  

 BUGS
 ----
 This does not work for FOURCC's that require escape codes to 
 represent them as a string.
